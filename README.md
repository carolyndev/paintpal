### Overview

Paintpal is a front-end painting web app. Users can drag their mouse across the canvas to draw free-form lines and express their creativity through a variety of brush sizes, brush colors, and coloring pages. This project is a submission toward the "Paint App - Becoming Bob Ross" Hackathon hosted by Mintbean.io.
